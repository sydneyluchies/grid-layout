# Grid layout

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Use Gridifier to create the responsive, grid-based layout.
- Your `main.css` file should only have the responsive website defaults, and `Open Sans` in `html`—nothing else. Don’t change `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`—anything. Except removing the `margin` from `body`.
- Text can be found inside the `content.txt` file.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

---

## Details

- *Typefaces:* `Open Sans` (include “regular 400”, “regular 400 italic” & “bold 700” from Google Fonts)
- *Text sizes:* unchanged
- *Margins & paddings:* unchanged, except for the `body`
- *Expected class names:* `.img-flex`, `.grid`, `.unit`, grid sizing classes
- *Gridifier settings:* defaults
